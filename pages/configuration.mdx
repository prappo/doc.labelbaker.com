# Configuration

After successful installation, you will find the config.php file in the root folder. 
This file is responsible for all the configuration of this application.

## Authentication system

We have used auth0 for user authentication and management system. 
If you want to turn on the user authentication system then 

* Go to https://auth0.com/ and create an account.
* After login in to your auth0 account go to Application > Create application.
* Then give your application a name and choose `Single Page Web Applications` and click create button.
* Then go to your application settings tab and copy `Domain` and `Client ID`. 
* Now go to your config.php file and paste the values against `data-auth-domain` and `data-auth-id`
* And lastly, change `enableAuth` from false to true.

## Assets API configuration.

We have used https://iconfinder.com API to search for icons/assets functionality. 
You just need an `API Key` and you can collect it for free from https://iconfinder.com.
You need to follow these simple steps to get the API key.
* Create an account at https://iconfinder.com. 
* Then go here https://www.iconfinder.com/account/applications.
* Then create an app and copy the API key.
* Put the API key against `icoFidnerKey` in the config.php file.
