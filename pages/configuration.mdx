## Authentication system

We have used auth0 for user authentication and management system. 
If you want to turn on the user authentication system then 

* Go to https://auth0.com/ and create an account.
* After login in to your auth0 account go to Application > Create application.
* Then give your application a name and choose `Single Page Web Applications` and click create button.
* Then go to your application settings tab and copy `Domain` and `Client ID`. 
* Now go to your config.php file and paste the values against `data-auth-domain` and `data-auth-id`
* And lastly, change `enableAuth` from false to true.
