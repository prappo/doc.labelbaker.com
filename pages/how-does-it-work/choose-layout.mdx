# Choose Layout

Before starting your design, it is good practice to choose your layout first. Layout choosing means setting up the page size and the label size. You can set up it later but do it fast to avoid any kind of further hassles.
You can do it in three different ways. 
Go to File > New and set your label page size. It will create a new design viewport
Or you can do the same things from Document Settings which exists on Editor > Document Settings.
Or you can go to Layouts > Layout Maker and set input your label and page size and hit apply button to apply. 

Choose whatever suit for you.
