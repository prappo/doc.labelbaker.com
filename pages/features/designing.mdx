# Designing
To make your desired label we made a variety of functionality.

14 designing tools/elements available to make any kind of label you want to make. Each tool has various customizing properties that help you with the pro designing experience.
Available Tools:
Text, Simple Barcode, Image, SVG, QRcode, Advance Barcode, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, Polygon, Line, Star, Arc, and Oval.

You can easily scale, rotate, increase or decrease an elementâ€™s height/width by simply dragging.
Learn more about tools in the tools section.

You will find tools under the Editor tab.

We included a huge assets library for you. Assets are basically SVG icons. There are some default icons that will load when you open the application for the first time. You can search your desired icons from the assets search option.
